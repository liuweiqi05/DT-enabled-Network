# DT-enabled-Network

The code uses RL to reduce the time required for completing tasks in a heterogeneous IoT network that is powered by edge computing. This is achieved by optimizing the device association process, allocating appropriate bandwidth to each device, determining the offloading ratio for different services to edge servers, and computing the capacities allocated to each offloaded service task of every device.
